# CrossHatch
Crosshatch design tool
This tool allows to create and print crosspatch patterns.

Building this design tool will enable to test some interesting parameters and learn a lot for your first 3d food printing tool!

This app will generate a file that is able to print food following a crosshatch pattern. To control the design of the crosshatch we will have the following input parameters:
Number of rows (#rows)
Number of columns (#columns)
Layers
Max Length

This four parameter will control the dimension and shape of the crosshatch
